            <h2>Let's learn how to make this amazing Chicken Soup!</h2>
            <p>One batch of my homemade chicken stock amounts to about 2 quarts. With this, I freeze one quart and place the other in the refrigerator to use throughout the week. If I need another quart for a recipe like risotto, braised chicken dish, or a chicken chili, I'll reach for one of the quarts in the freezer—no problem.</p>

            <h3>Step-By-Step Instructions</h3>
            <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect to do:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Add aromatics, like celery, carrot, onion, and garlic-to a pressure cooker, such as an Instant Pot. Add chicken stock to cover by about 1 inch. If you don't have enough chicken broth or stock, you can make up the difference with tap water.</li>
                <li>Set the pressure cooker to cook over high heat over high pressure until vegetables are soft and meat is tender and falling off the bone, about 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
